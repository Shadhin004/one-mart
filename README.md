# One‑Mart – Full‑Stack E‑Commerce Platform

## Project Overview

Welcome to **One‑Mart**, a full‑stack e‑commerce platform built with Next.js and modern web technologies. This project demonstrates my ability to architect and implement scalable, maintainable web applications — from frontend interfaces to backend services and database integration.

## Key Features & Projects

Here are the core highlights of this project:

| Feature | Tech Stack | What It Demonstrates |
|--------|------------|-----------------------|
| Frontend SPA & SSR | Next.js, React, CSS/SCSS | Optimized UI with server‑side rendering, SEO, responsive layouts |
| Backend API / Database | Next.js API routes, MySQL | Data modelling, CRUD operations, authentication, performance |
| Authentication & Security | JWT / NextAuth.js | Handling user sessions, role‑based access, protecting endpoints |


## Technologies & Tools

Here are some of the major tools and frameworks I used:

- **Frontend / Frameworks**: Next.js  
- **Styling & UI**: CSS / SCSS  
- **Backend / API**: Next.js API Routes 
- **Database / ORM**: MySQL 
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js / JWT  
- **Other Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, React-hook-form  
- I love **learning and adapting** — if you spot something creative or new in the stack, I’d be happy to talk about it.

## Getting Started (Run Locally)

To get this project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shadhin004/one-mart.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory  
   ```bash
   cd one-mart
   ```

3. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or yarn / pnpm
   ```

4. Create & configure environment variables  
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # then update .env with your DB credentials, API keys, etc.
   ```

5. Run the development server  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or yarn dev / pnpm dev
   ```

6. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

##  Deployment & Production

This app is **production‑ready** and can be deployed on platforms like Vercel, Netlify (frontend) plus a backend server, or as a full-stack app on Vercel Serverless Functions. Make sure to set environment variables securely and configure your database and API keys accordingly.
